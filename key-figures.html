    <h1>Key Figures in Paris’s Colonial Art Networks</h1>
    <p>
      The figures below — whose names appear in <span style="color:#008000">green</span> within the Gallery dashboards
      — are the key actors who emerge from the provenance stories on this site. Together,
      they form part of the extensive colonial network that shaped, sustained, and financed
      the Paris art world.    
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The lives and careers of these people — mostly collectors, patrons, artists, and
      dealers — were closely intertwined with France’s colonial investments, transatlantic
      trade, and plantation economies. Their personal and professional activities expose
      the imperial and transatlantic entanglements that underpinned the creation,
      circulation, and display of art across Europe.
