The enigmatic painting, which some scholars have suggested represents the forces of light and dark, vision and blindness, was beloved by many “enlightened” French collectors of the eighteenth century who also profited from the transatlantic slave trade.",

In 1762, the marquis d’Argenson sold the Philosopher in Comtemplation to the duc de Choiseul (1719-85), who already owned its pendant, for 3000 livres. D’Argenson hoped to curry favor with Choiseul, another big art collector and one of the most powerful men in France. During the 1760s he served as foreign minister and directed French colonial policy. <br><br>Choiseul’s family had deep colonial and slaveholding ties in the Americas. His grandfather had been the colonial governor of Saint-Domingue (Haiti), and much of his wealth derived from his wife, Louise Honorine Crozat, whose grandfather, the financier Antoine Crozat (c. 1655-1738), was heavily involved in French colonization, especially in Louisiana. Choiseul and his wife lived in a lavish Parisian hôtel originally built for Crozat’s brother, another major art collector, and the family fortune fueled Choiseul’s art buying. <br><br>Choiseul was especially fond of 17th C. Dutch and Flemish art and owned several Rembrandts that he displayed in his hôtel. The Philosopher in Comtemplation was hung in the first room (premier cabinet) according to the famous Choiseul snuffbox, a gold tobacco box decorated with miniatures of the duc’s collection, now one of the national treasures of the Louvre . </p>",

D’Angiviller’s vision for the museum, housed in a palace that was also the headquarters of the French Academy, was to glorify the Crown’s peerless collections and arts patronage. However, it would be the new Revolutionary government that would open the Louvre to the public in 1793, the same year Louis XVI was executed. Hubert Robert’s painting of the Grand Gallery presents a utopian, aspirational view of its civic potential, but in another painting he envisioned the same space in ruins—as if to acknowledge that France, like other powerful empires of the past, could readily topple. </p>",
