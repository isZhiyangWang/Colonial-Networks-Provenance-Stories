    "description": "<p><strong>Artist:</strong> Titian</p><p>Titian’s Perseus and Andromeda was originally painted in the 1550s for Spain’s King Philip II (1527-98) during the so-called “Golden Age” of Spanish art and imperial expansion. Titian was one of the king’s favorite painters and continued to be one of the most sought-after \"Old Masters\" by Europe’s elite art collectors. This particular canvas is in fact associated with two other \"Old Masters\" who may have owned it: the Italian sculptor Leone Leoni, who was famously a galley slave, and the Flemish painter Anthony Van Dyck, who acquired it in 1623. Both artists were based in Milan at this time.</p><br><p>Current Location: <a href='https://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMP/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=64901&viewType=detailView' target='_blank'>Wallace Collection</a></p>",
