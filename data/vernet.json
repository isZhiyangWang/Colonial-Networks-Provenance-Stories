      "description": "<p>Vernet’s painting, which depicts a ruler of ancient Rome proudly parading enslaved captives and other spoils of war through the city streets, exemplifies the popularity of Neoclassicism during the era of the French Revolution. It also suggests how Neoclassicism may have been linked to proslavery and pro-colonial ideas held by its owners, among them the wealthy financier Jean-Joseph de Laborde.</p><br><p>Current Location: <a href='https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437885' target='_blank'>The Met</a></p>"

        "text": "Vernet painted his ambitious Triumph of Aemilius Paulus in 1789, while he was a student of the French Academy in Rome. This enormous canvas (so large that he had to rent a bigger studio in Rome to complete it) was intended to cap off Vernet’s splash debut on the Paris art scene. He included it as the centerpiece of his portfolio of works for admission to the Academy, and he showed it at the Salons of 1789 and 1791. Neoclassical paintings of Roman history were major attractions at the Salons of the 1780s (we can see several in Martini’s print of the Salon of 1787), and scholars often link these paintings to calls for revolution and reform, specifically to the desire to metaphorically liberate French citizens from an oppressive absolutist regime. Vernet’s painting, however, depicts slavery in a different sense. It represents a famed triumphal procession of a Roman consul who had conquered a territory and brought back 150,000 enslaved captives, and thus seems to celebrate colonial domination and enslavement as fundamental to the glory and prosperity of Rome—and perhaps to France as well, given the fact that the question of maintaining slavery in the colonies was being hotly debated at this time. Salon critics noticed that Vernet included several ancient monuments depicting enslaved captives that had not been built at the time this ancient procession had taken place (and he also exaggerated the representation of captives on these monuments), implying that Vernet may have wanted to stoke these Revolutionary debates about slavery—but from a colonial rather than a metaphorical perspective.",

        "text": "The possible proslavery subtext of Vernet’s painting is supported by the fact that it was bought by Jean-Joseph de Laborde (1724-94), an extremely wealthy financier who was one of the largest landowners in Saint-Domingue, and who had personally overseen the trafficking of more than 10,000 enslaved Africans to the colony. Laborde acquired the painting in 1791, as he and other slave traders, despite the Revolution, were continuing to prosper. His son, François Laborde de Méréville (1761-1801), became a deputy for the new Revolutionary government (he appears near the center of David’s Oath of the Tennis Court) and was a member of the proslavery lobby that argued for the need to maintain slavery in the colonies. The story behind this painting suggests that scholars should rethink Neoclassicism as a style associated mainly with liberty and reform and acknowledge how some Neoclassical artworks endorsed a vision of slavery in the ancient world, one that 18th C. colonial patrons used to model and justify their own practices.",
