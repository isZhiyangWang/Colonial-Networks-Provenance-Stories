      "text": "<p>Watteau painted the Pleasures of the Ball around 1715-17. He is best known for inventing the fête galante, a genre representing elegant elites entertaining each other in an idyllic outdoor setting. This same period coincided with the inclusion of Black figures in Watteau’s paintings and drawings, some of whom appear to have been modeled from life.<br><br>Watteau’s Pleasures is one of several fêtes galantes that includes Black figures: a young boy in the crowd and another who stands on a balcony at the far right and looks down at the dancers. He wears a turban and possibly (though it is less clear) a metal collar, which would denote his enslavement. The presence of enslaved African and Afro-descended individuals—most of whom were trafficked from France’s Caribbean colonies to serve as domestic laborers in the metropole—was increasing in Paris at this moment, and the inclusion of these Black figures makes us wonder: What was the artist’s own opinion about this practice? What does it mean that he seems to have made the boy on the balcony a surrogate spectator? How does this change our understanding of the painting and the fête galante genre as being preoccupied with pleasure? “Pleasure” at whose cost?</p>",

(This same hôtel on the rue Richelieu would later be the residence of the duc de Choiseul.)  <br><br>While the Black figure in Pleasures is inspired by works by Veronese and other artists Crozat collected, his presence raises the question of whether Watteau could have based the figure on a real-life enslaved model in Paris. <br><br>Pierre Crozat and his brother Antoine made their fortunes in maritime speculation, and from 1712-17 Antoine had a commercial monopoly on French Louisiana and controlled part of France’s slave trade. Despite royal restrictions, it would have been easy for the Crozats and their friends to traffic enslaved individuals into Paris, and indeed in 1716 the Crown relaxed such restrictions, acknowledging the desire among metropolitan elites for enslaved domestic servants. </p>",

Jullienne, who followed his family’s tradition in investing in colonial trade (specifically, as Charlotte Guichard points out, in indigo to dye textiles), took over managing the Gobelins in 1729, and he built a residence onsite that housed his extensive art collection. Another cousin named Montullé to whom Julienne bequeathed the collection oversaw the creation of a beautiful album depicting rooms in which these artwokrs were displayed, although it doesn’t specify where Pleasures was hung. <br><br>In 1783, the comte de Vaudreuil bought Watteau’s painting at Montullé’s posthumous sale, but he flipped it a few years later.
