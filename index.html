          Art works tell stories – not just through their subject matter, but through their lives as objects. Why were artworks made? Who owned them? Who saw them? Where did they go? And how did they end up in our museums?

        <p class="intro-text">
          This interactive website attempts to tell new stories about old master European artworks through the lens of ownership or provenance. It focuses specifically on objects with strong ties to colonial commerce and enslavement.
